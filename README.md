## 💼 I'm currently working on
- 🌿 Smart Plant Monitoring System (Python, Flask, OpenCV, React)
- 🛰️ Autonomous Rover Control for UofT's Robotics for Space Exploration Team (ROS, SMACH, C++)

## 🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on
- AI/ML research projects (image processing, automation)
- ROS-based robotics and control systems
- Full-stack web applications with real-world impact

## 🙋 I'm looking for help with
- Advanced reinforcement learning frameworks
- Scalable cloud architecture and edge computing

## 🌱 I'm currently learning
- Deep RL and computer vision integration  
- Microservices and container orchestration using Kubernetes

## 💬 Ask me about
- Writing CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps  
- Reverse-engineering legacy systems  
- How we built a 4K super-resolution image model at UTMIST

## ⚡ Fun fact
My first robot could retrieve objects autonomously—now I’m building smarter systems that understand their environment!
